# StockApplication  
Co-author: [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/piotrkotlowski)  

## Description  
This application was created as a project required to complete the **Advanced Object-Oriented and Functional Programming** (JAVA) course. We decided to align the theme with our field of study (**Analysis and Data Engineering**). Therefore, we developed a tool to collect stock market data, exchange rates, and commodity prices and visualize them.  

## Main Features  
Our app allows users to:  
1. **Visualize** stock market data  
2. **Browse** tabular data  
3. **Search** for company data  
4. **Access** historical stock price data  
5. **Retrieve** real-time data  
6. **View** current exchange rates  
7. **Check** current commodity prices  
8. **Convert** major currency pair prices  
9. **Analyze** historical currency pair data  
10. **Download** data  

## Setting Up the Environment  
### JDK Version  
The app requires **JDK 21**.  

### Libraries  
Since this is a **Maven** project, you don't need to install any additional libraries manuallyâ€”Maven handles dependencies automatically.  

#### External Libraries Used  
- **Frontend:** JavaFX
